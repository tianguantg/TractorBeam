# Tractor Beam Context

Tractor Beam is a remote co-op transport project for *The Binding of Isaac:
Repentance+*. This context defines the project language used in code, roadmap,
and user-facing documentation.

## Language

**Official Mode**:
A session mode that leaves the game on its normal Steam online path.
_Avoid_: vanilla mode, Steam mode

**Fallback Mode**:
A session mode that uses Tractor Beam transport while allowing Steam receive fallback.
_Avoid_: Bridge Safe Mode, hybrid mode, safe mode

**Pure Mode**:
A session mode that uses only Tractor Beam transport for the hooked packet path.
_Avoid_: Bridge Pure Mode, forced mode, relay-only mode

**Bridge Client**:
The local runtime that coordinates a player's Tractor Beam session without owning presentation.
_Avoid_: sidecar, GUI, app

**Bridge GUI**:
The desktop presentation layer used by players to configure and control a Tractor Beam session.
_Avoid_: client, sidecar

**Bridge Core**:
The Rust code crate that contains the Bridge Client runtime, diagnostics, Steam detection, and local configuration helpers. It consumes shared protocol crates but does not own their wire contracts.
_Avoid_: GUI, relay, hook

**Protocol**:
The versioned message language and packet formats at one component boundary. Local IPC Protocol is shared by the Bridge Client and Native Hook; Relay Protocol is shared by the Bridge Client and Relay Server. They are independent contracts. Protocol describes what is sent, not how it is carried.
_Avoid_: transport, runtime, socket loop

**Local IPC Protocol**:
The typed `TBI3` message contract used only between one Bridge Client session and its Native Hook over an IPv4 loopback TCP connection. Endpoint readiness means the loopback connection is authenticated; Hook readiness additionally requires the Steam packet hooks to be installed.
_Avoid_: Relay Protocol, UDP protocol, socket loop

**Relay Protocol v2**:
The `TBR2` compatibility bootstrap, control messages, and bounded binary data/probe frames shared by the Bridge Client and Relay Server.
_Avoid_: Local IPC Protocol, Relay Transport, room state

**Direct Protocol**:
The versioned, bounded control, path-check, and gameplay-frame contract exchanged directly between two Peers in a LAN Session.
_Avoid_: Relay Protocol, LAN discovery policy, adapter selection

**Relay Transport**:
The network carriage selected to move Protocol envelopes between a Bridge Client and a Relay Server.
_Avoid_: protocol, Relay Server, session mode

**Transport Choice**:
The single Relay Transport selected by one Bridge Client session.
_Avoid_: session mode, automatic fallback

**Input Delay**:
A player-controlled Isaac remote co-op delay value used to make remote inputs
feel stable under Relay Server latency.
_Avoid_: onlineInputDelay, manager offset

**Client Bundle**:
The versioned player-facing package that ships the Bridge GUI, Bridge Client, Native Hook, and Injector together.
_Avoid_: hook release, GUI release

**Native Hook**:
The in-process component that redirects Isaac's Steam packet path into Tractor Beam.
_Avoid_: mod, plugin

**Injector**:
The local component that places the Native Hook into the Isaac process.
_Avoid_: launcher

**Relay Server**:
The public server that forwards Tractor Beam room traffic between joined peers.
_Avoid_: server, directory

**Directory Service**:
The authority that publishes trusted Relay Server metadata.
_Avoid_: relay, server list

**Session Credential**:
A high-entropy bearer secret that identifies one Room and authorizes Peers to join it.
_Avoid_: room name, admission, session key

**Room**:
The player-facing co-op group whose peers share one Session Credential; it has no separate user-editable name.
_Avoid_: room name, relay registry key, lobby code

**Room Path Quality**:
The measured round-trip latency, variation, and probe loss between two Bridge Clients over their selected gameplay path.
_Avoid_: Relay latency, game packet loss, connection score

**Relay Control RTT**:
The measured round-trip time of the control ping/pong loop between the Bridge Client and the active room's Relay Server. It reflects server reachability and control-plane latency, and is displayed in the bottom status bar and lightweight monitor window (e.g. `31ms`).
_Avoid_: UDP data path RTT, Peer Path latency, game ping

**Steam Identity Mismatch Handling**:
The runtime protection flow triggered when Isaac's running Steam identity differs from the identity admitted to the Room. The Bridge Client pauses gameplay traffic while intentionally retaining the Native Hook in memory; upon synchronizing the Steam account through the Bridge GUI, gameplay resumes automatically without restarting Isaac.
_Avoid_: hook ejection, crash recovery, game restart requirement

**Join Code**:
The single player-shareable value that carries one Room entry point and one Session Credential.
_Avoid_: room code, invite code, admission code

**Peer**:
A player endpoint admitted to one Room with a Session Credential.
_Avoid_: user, member

**LAN Session**:
A session whose Peers are already mutually IP-reachable through a physical LAN or third-party virtual LAN.
_Avoid_: Internet P2P, automatic NAT traversal

**Room Creator**:
The Peer that creates a LAN Session by generating its Session Credential and first LAN Join Code; it has no special runtime authority.
_Avoid_: Room Host, game host, coordinator

**Introducer**:
The Peer named by a LAN Join Code that supplies one joining Peer with the Room's current Peer-discovery information.
_Avoid_: Room Host, Relay Server, leader

**Peer Path**:
The nominated direct gameplay path between two Peers in a LAN Session.
_Avoid_: Relay path, room entry point

**Diagnostics Bundle**:
A support artifact containing run logs, environment facts, counters, and errors.
_Avoid_: log zip, report

**Readiness Preflight**:
A startup check that verifies the local Bridge path is ready before gameplay,
including configuration, injection, Native Hook initialization, and local
receive endpoints.
_Avoid_: health check, network test

**Incident Snapshot**:
A compact diagnostics record captured when the Bridge Client or Relay Server
observes an abnormal data-plane condition.
_Avoid_: crash report, trace dump

**Advanced Transport**:
An optional non-baseline transport layer for hostile networks or later hardening.
_Avoid_: normal relay mode

## Relationships

- A **Client Bundle** contains one **Bridge GUI**, one **Bridge Client**, one **Native Hook**, and one **Injector**.
- **Bridge Core** provides the code used by the **Bridge GUI** to control a **Bridge Client** session.
- A **Bridge Client** and **Native Hook** exchange **Local IPC Protocol** messages.
- A **Bridge Client** and **Relay Server** exchange **Relay Protocol v2** messages.
- Two **Bridge Clients** exchange **Direct Protocol** messages over one **Peer Path** in a **LAN Session**.
- A **Bridge GUI** controls a **Bridge Client**.
- A **Bridge Client** joins at most one **Room** using one **Session Credential** per active session.
- A **LAN Session** is initially created by exactly one **Room Creator**.
- Every admitted **Peer** is equal and may create a **Join Code** naming itself as **Introducer**.
- An **Introducer** assists discovery for one join and gains no control over membership or gameplay.
- A **LAN Session** carries baseline gameplay traffic over pairwise **Peer Paths**.
- **LAN Session** membership may change while each **Peer Path** becomes usable or recovers independently.
- Selecting an **Introducer** endpoint establishes the initial join path and a local candidate preference; it does not pin the **LAN Session** to one adapter.
- Every **Peer Path** nominates and recovers its direct candidate pair independently; different paths may use different local adapters.
- Established **Peer Paths** do not depend on the original **Room Creator** or any particular **Introducer**.
- A **Bridge Client** uses one **Transport Choice** to exchange **Protocol** envelopes with a **Relay Server** during an external Relay session.
- **Input Delay** is adjusted through the **Bridge GUI** and applied by the
  **Native Hook** when Isaac is ready.
- A **Relay Server** forwards packets only among **Peers** admitted with the same **Session Credential**.
- A **Join Code** contains exactly one Relay or LAN discovery entry point and one **Session Credential**; one LAN entry point may carry a bounded set of endpoint candidates for the same **Introducer**.
- **Room Path Quality** describes one Bridge Client's selected gameplay path to another **Peer**, whether direct or relayed.
- Creating a new **Room** rotates the **Session Credential**; stopping and restarting the same local session does not.
- A **Directory Service** publishes metadata about one or more **Relay Servers**.
- A **Diagnostics Bundle** describes one local **Bridge Client** run.
- A **Readiness Preflight** runs before a player treats a **Bridge Client**
  session as playable.
- An **Incident Snapshot** may be included in a **Diagnostics Bundle**.
- A future FEC or redundancy design would be an **Advanced Transport** and
  **Transport Choice**, not a UDP profile.

## Example Dialogue

> **Dev:** "Should the **Bridge GUI** reconnect the relay socket?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The **Bridge GUI** asks the **Bridge Client** to start or stop a session; reconnect behavior belongs to the **Bridge Client**."

## Flagged Ambiguities

- "client" was used to mean both the user-facing application and the local bridge runtime. Resolved: use **Bridge GUI** for presentation, **Bridge Client** for runtime, and **Client Bundle** for the versioned package.
- "sidecar" was used for the early local bridge process. Resolved: use **Bridge Client** for the product term.
- "server" was used for both relay forwarding and future trusted server discovery. Resolved: use **Relay Server** for forwarding and **Directory Service** for trusted metadata.
- "protocol" and "transport" were used interchangeably. Resolved: use **Protocol** for message formats and **Relay Transport** for network carriage.
- One "Protocol" previously implied one format shared by all three runtime components. Resolved: use **Local IPC Protocol** for Bridge Client/Native Hook and **Relay Protocol v2** for Bridge Client/Relay Server.
- "mode" was used for both session behavior and network carriage. Resolved: use **Official Mode**, **Fallback Mode**, and **Pure Mode** for session behavior; use **Transport Choice** for UDP or TCP carriage.
- "room", "room name", "admission", and "join code" described overlapping parts of one player-visible join flow. Resolved: **Room** remains the player-facing co-op group, but it has no separately editable name; use **Session Credential** for its single high-entropy routing/admission secret and **Join Code** for the value players copy or import.
- "host" can mean the Isaac game/lobby host or a Tractor Beam discovery entry point. Resolved: avoid **Room Host**; use **Room Creator** only for room creation and **Introducer** for the Peer named by a particular LAN Join Code.
- "Relay latency" or monitor window latency was ambiguous as to whether it measured the peer-to-peer data transport or the server control loop. Resolved: latency displayed in the status bar and lightweight monitor window is the **Relay Control RTT** to the active room's Relay Server, not UDP data path RTT.
- Steam account mismatch handling was ambiguous as to whether the Native Hook needed to be reinjected. Resolved: upon a mismatch, the Bridge Client pauses gameplay and preserves the loaded **Native Hook**; synchronizing the account automatically resumes gameplay without an Isaac restart.
